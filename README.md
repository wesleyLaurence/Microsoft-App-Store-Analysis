# Microsoft App Store Analysis
This notebook analyzes the [Windows Store dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/vishnuvarthanrao/windows-store) by Vishnu Varthan Rao from Kaggle. This dataset consists of six features: app rating, number of people rated, category, date and price. We will perform some exploratory data analysis & visualization, then train a linear regression model to predict app price.
